# Age Classifier and Age Guessing Game
# Overview
This program is a Python implementation of an age classifier and an age guessing game. The age classifier categorizes a person's age into four groups: child, teenager, adult, and senior citizen. The age guessing game generates a random age and allows the user to guess it.

# Features
- Age classification into four groups: child, teenager, adult, and senior citizen
- Age guessing game with a randomly generated age
- User-friendly menu-driven interface
# Usage
- Run the program by executing python age_classifier.py (assuming the file is named age_classifier.py).
- Enter your choice by typing the corresponding number (1, 2, or 3).
- Follow the prompts to classify your age or play the age guessing game.
# Code Structure
The program consists of a single Python file, age_classifier.py, which contains the following components:

- A logo printed at the beginning of the program
- An AgeClassifier class with methods for age classification and age guessing
- A main function that implements the menu-driven interface
# Dependencies
Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.9)
random module for generating random ages
